# Ngrok-File-Manager

This works best with SSH serveo and as well as ngrok

## All you need to do is run django server using:

## python manage.py runserver

open terminal and run ssh or ngrok

new features will be implemented soon and documentation and code refactoring will be done soon...

##### feel free to give advices and improvements
